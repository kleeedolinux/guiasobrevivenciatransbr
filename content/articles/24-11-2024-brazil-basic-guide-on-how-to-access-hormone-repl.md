[Brazil] Basic guide on how to access Hormone Replacement Therapy through private heathcareThis guide is intended for immigrants, foreign workers, travellers, or people planning to immigrate to Brazil.IndexWho can have HRT in Brazil?Getting the HRT & pricesThrough insurancePaying for the consultations yourselfWho can have HRT in Brazil?You can have HRT by law if you are 18+, or 16+ if your parents give consent and are present on all consultations. However, many hospitals ignore the law and give fights over if 16-17 olds can actually have HRT because of transphobia.Puberty blockers are generally not avaliable in Brazil at all. It is legal at any age, but there is no way to purchase or get it prescripted except in a specific free healthcare unit with a years long waiting lists in one city (São Paulo).You can get HRT even if you aren’t brazilian. This means you can legally get HRT if you are a immigrant, refugees, foreign worker, traveller, or etc though the means differ. There is an option of completly free HRT, but it is not the one this guide will discuss. If you want that, please go to the basic guide on how to get free HRT through SUS.Getting the HRT & pricesYou can get an endocrinologist through insurance or paying for the consultations. In all these options, you’ll have to pay for the hormonal medication separatedly.For transfem HRT -  the middleground price is about 50 reais a month. It would be about 100 per purchase.For transmasc HRT - the middle price is  100 reais per month. It would be about 200 per purchase.Through insuranceAn insurance is a paid medical plan that allows you to have medical consultations completly covered or partially paid for. You pay for the insurance monthly.Prices for basic insurances are between 150-400 reais a month. This allows you to have several services besides only the HRT medical supervision, and can be really worth it since the free SUS system generally is very bad for emergency care.An insurance will not cover any medications, and this includes buying the actual HRT.Call your healthcare plan to know if you need a general doctor visit first. If you do, schedule one and then in the consultation say you want the redirectioning to the endocrinologist. You have the right by law to have this covered by the insurance, so they can’t deny you in any way, shape or form, even if they don’t have a doctor that does that in the city or in their payroll. They are oblied to get one for you.Paying the consultations by yourselfFind an endocrinologist that preferably has HRT experience. The consultation will go between 150-400 reais usually, plus whoever much you have to pay for doing the bloodwork exams (30-100). This is the most expensive option. It does not include prices for the actual medication later.
