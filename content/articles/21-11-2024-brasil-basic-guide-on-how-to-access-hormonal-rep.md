Reminder: You’ll either have to present yourself as wanting masculine or feminine hormones. There are no other methods of hormonal transition.

However, every gender identity is valid and you can ask to be respected as non-binary by the doctos, as long as you specify to them you want HRT of a certain gender.

For example: Assigned Male at Birth. You’d say “I want feminizing HRT”

This is because the doctors here are extremly weird about this, and there have been several cases of them not understanding the situation and giving prescriptions of the wrong gendered hormone. This is because of a lack of understanding.

Brazil grants full acces to the SUS for all immigrants and foreign workers. If you have a residency visa, you can use the SUS and get HRT. It also grants limited access to free emergency care for all people, even travellers and illegal immigrants - however, this will not usually grant you HRT because you need a document of residency to access scheduled care.

You can try to do this in foreign languages, but it will be extremely difficult and only some select doctors and attendants will be able to understand you. Access to HRT is already scarce in Brazil, so understand that your options become not only severely limited, but also almost impossible.

Ideally, either be able to communicate in portuguese in a basic capacity or know a close language such as spanish. You have to be able to at least communicate in all of those steps that will be showed. Consider bringing a friend that knows both languages as help. Just because someone at a certain step understood you, doesn’t mean they’ll understand on the next step.

Índex:

Go to your city’s UBS (Unidade Basica de Saúde), specifically the one that cares for your region. Call beforehand to see if they are the ones in charge of your region. If they aren’t, find the one that’s in charge of your address. If you go to the right one that takes care of that, and they say that they aren’t in charge of HRT, it’s a lie and wrong training of the employees.

Bring:

It does not need to be in your name if you explain it as you living with someone else or renting. They don’t usually verify. Just make sure your address is of the area they are in charge of.

Ask for a consultation with a general doctor (clínico geral). it does not need any reason or justification. If they ask you why, you can say it’s for redirection to the endocrinologist. If they refuse, it’s wrong employee training again, as this is your right.

You can ask to use a social name.

Nome social: The name you use that is not your name legally. In Brazil, a social name can both be official (appears in a document besides the legal name) or not. Government institutions and state-based businesses are oblied to respect all forms of social name, as well as both private and public means of education.

The SUS is oblied by law to use your social name even if it’s not on a document. If they refuse, it’s wrong training of the employees again, and you can call administration and point your right by law. By law, you have the right to be treated as your social name and gender.

The SUS system will never ever notify your parents, family, or whoever else that you are transitioning with HRT!

As a person after the age of majority, which is 18 in Brazil, the government understands that you as responsable for your own health and the owner of your own data. In the case of minors, the parents need to give consent any way. If you are an emancipated minor, you are the same as someone after legal majority and have the same rights as them, including not needing parental consent. However, you’ll need to bring the documents that prove your emancipation.

What may happen, however, is that you give your house phone number to them in your contact info, and that they try to call for some emergency causing the wrong person to get the call. Even so, they prefer not to tell third parties what they contacted you for.

At the day of the consultation (it will not be the same day you request it) you ask for the redirectioning for the endocrinologist and inform what gender you are transitioning hormonally to.  You tell the doctor it is for transgender hormonal transition. The doctor can’t refuse to mark the other consultation, except on specific cases describe after. The SUS is obligated by law to cover this treatment without any psychological avaliation or “proof”.

The doctor will also give you the papers to start the physical exams you need for the endo consultation. It is with those exams that the endo will know how to adjust the dose for you and if you have any serious risks with HRT, as well as a basis to monitor how your transition is going for next adjustments.

Then you go to the other consultation when you manage to get it scheduled. They should ideally have experience with hormonal transition. The exams will be seen and you’ll get a prescription for the hormones. You can’t choose which will be the form of the hormones. They are also free and must be taken our of the SUS pharmacy if availiable. See exceptions below.

The starting process usually takes some few months, but some cases can take more than years.

After the endocrinologist, you take the free hormones in accord to what your prescription was. But there are some important exceptions to this process:
